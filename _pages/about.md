Yo! I'm Xulong Tang, you can call me Ben! A first year PhD student from the Department of Computer Science at The University of Texas at Dallas. I worked under the mentorship of Professor [Rawan Alghofaili](https://rawanmg.com/) at [Human-Centered eXD Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/rawanmg). 

**Email**: Xulong.Tang@utdallas.edu

**Research interest**: Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Mixed Reality, Computer Vision, Multimedia Retrieval, Multimodal Learning

In addition to my research, I am also a game developer. I have used Unity to create a VR educational game for teaching children about the universe at the [Sci-Tech Discovery Center](https://mindstretchingfun.org/). I have also contributed to the development of an unreleased third-person survival shooter game project using Unreal and C++, where I was responsible for Gameplay and User Interface.
